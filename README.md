## Binder Badge to start the Binder environment:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ElMehdiAbbes/DeepLearning.git/master)


## How to perform the exercise?
Click on the Launch Binder button, then a Binder window will open. 
A docker container with all necessary images will be created automatically. After a successful creation, a Jupyter window will be opened. Open Tensorflow_Deep_learning.ipynb and then click on Run All at the top of Cell.

## Expected results ? 
1. Explorative data analysis of bank_note_data.csv data.
2. Generate some visualizations for a general overview.
3. Data preparation: data will be normalized.
4. Creating of Contrib.learn.
5. Creation of a DNN classifier from learn and set classes to 2 and hindden:units to [10,20,10]
6. Evaluation of the data.
